    <h3> Lifestyle choices. </h3>
    <p>
      As stated by the wise words of LMFAO, Erryday, I am shuffling. I have given up lifting my feet to walk, except when I am climbing stairs of course, though I try to avoid them.
      I find myself shuffling through life, using my lifting energy for more important purposes.
      Come with me, read my passages, and soon enough, you, too, will be shuffling.

    <ol> <h3>  Life goals. </h3>

      <li> Find a lover for my cat </li>
      <li> Receive a proper education in the art of fielding (is that a book or a course?) </li>
      <li> Experience a reality without color</li>
      <li> Regain my ability to perceive color</li>
    </ol>

    <ul> <h3> Moments I want to remember </h3>
      <li> When I wrote my first full-length romance novel </li>
      <li> When I watched Gossip Girl and experienced true tragedy</li>
      <li> <a href= "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Ara_ararauna_Luc_Viatour.jpg" > That time I read about that brown bird and decided I was an expert in animal life </a> </li>
      <li> The moment I realized I've never seen a bird</li>
      <li> The moment I realized pigeons were birds </li>
